# Supervised Machine Learning Regression and Classification

In this course we are going to build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn. We'll also build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

## Course Objectives

- Define machine learning
- Define supervised learning
- Define unsupervised learning
- Write and run Python code in Jupyter Notebooks
- Define a regression model
- Implement and visualize a cost function
- Implement gradient descent
- Optimize a regression model using gradient descent

# Week 3: Classification

## Learning Objectives
- Use logistic regression for binary classification
- Implement logistic regression for binary classification
- Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance

## Formula for Sigmoid function
The formula for a sigmoid function is as follows -

𝑔(𝑧) = 1 / 1 + 𝑒 ^ -𝑧

In the case of logistic regression, z (the input to the sigmoid function), is the output of a linear regression model.
